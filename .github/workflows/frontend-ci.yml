      # No tests are defined for Playwright yet, but here are some ideas for future checks:
      # - name: Install Playwright
      #   run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # - name: Run Playwright page checks
      #   run: npx playwright test

      # Optionally, you can use a simple crawler like linkinator for basic checks:
      # - name: Check all links with linkinator
      #   run: npx linkinator http://localhost:3000 --silent
